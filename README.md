# ⚙️ Project Workflow

## Phase 1 – Dataset Collection

Emotion datasets were collected from publicly available sources including:

- Emotion Dataset
- GoEmotions Dataset
- Empathetic Dialogues Dataset

---

## Phase 2 – Data Preprocessing

The collected data undergoes:

- Text Cleaning
- Lowercase Conversion
- Removing URLs
- Removing Special Characters
- Tokenization
- Sequence Padding

---

## Phase 3 – Model Training

Two Deep Learning models are used:

### 🔹 BiLSTM

- Word Embedding
- Bidirectional LSTM
- Dense Layers
- Softmax Classification

### 🔹 DistilBERT

- Fine-tuned Transformer Model
- Context-aware Emotion Detection
- Higher Prediction Accuracy

---

## Phase 4 – Emotion Prediction

The system predicts emotions such as:

- 😀 Joy
- 😢 Sadness
- 😡 Anger
- 😨 Fear
- ❤️ Love
- 😲 Surprise

The final prediction is generated using the best confidence score.

---

## Phase 5 – Keyword Enhancement

Important emotional keywords are extracted from user input to improve understanding.

Example:

Input:

```
I feel nervous about my exams.
```

Detected Keyword:

```
fear
```

---

## Phase 6 – AI Guidance

Google Gemini AI generates personalized guidance based on:

- Selected Category
- User Problem
- Detected Emotion

Example:

```
Category:
Academics

Emotion:
Fear

Response:
Break your study schedule into small goals, practice regularly, and maintain confidence. Consistent preparation reduces exam anxiety.
```

---

## Phase 7 – Database Storage

Each prediction is stored in SQLite with:

- User Text
- Emotion
- Confidence
- AI Response
- Timestamp

---

## Phase 8 – Analytics Dashboard

The dashboard visualizes:

- Emotion Distribution
- Confidence Scores
- Prediction Timeline

using Plotly charts.

---

# 🌍 Real World Example

### User Input

Category:

```
